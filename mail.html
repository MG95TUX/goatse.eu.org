At our webbsite we have had the nasty experience of receiving a
pornographic picture from "firewall" with the homepage www.goatse.cx
<BR>
Since our homesite is a kindergartensite it is abusive and missleading
for our visitors at our gustbook.If you have the possibility to trace the
person who put the picture inour guestbook we would be very pleased.

Your site has truly become a classic. So much, in fact, that a group of my
dedicated gamer friends have honored it (and promoted it) in a more creative
way that just spraying it on guestbooks and bulletin boards, which is quite
lame.<BR>
We play Ultima Online (http://www.owo.com), a multiplayer online game of the
likes of Everquest and Asheron's Call, which you might be familiar. You
basically run around and kill people, but in a more sophisticated way than
quake (characters are persistent, people own property, etc). In this game,
your character looks something like this:<BR>
<BR>
[Guildtitle, GAB]<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /\<BR>
<BR>
..where GAB is your Guild ABbreviation. In my infinite wisdom, I created
the following guild with the mandatory following guildtitle for every
member:<BR>
<BR>
[http://goatse, CX]<BR>
<BR>
And told each person we killed (whom we made sure we knew in real life and
we knew they were over 18 of course) the following:<BR>
<BR>
Congratulations! You have just died! See your corpse at http://goatse.cx!<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, your site rocks man. DON'T CHANGE A THING.<BR>
(Note: I have since disbanded this guild for fear of getting banned from
the game, and because I don't want to show it to any kids. I'm not that
bad. It was fun while it lasted. I'll send you some screenshots if I can
find any. Sorry for the lame stick figures.) :)<BR>

We think goatse.cx is such a kickass page, so to promote it, we have created a
clan that plays games such as Half-life, Counterstrike, Quake 3 and Unreal. All
players use the tag [goatse] in front of their names. The clan has a homepage,<BR>

Always when playing on the net we bug all the players to visit the page. We
also try to make everyone else we know go there as well, and I think your site

<BR>
Sorry for the boring tone of the email, but I am in work-mode.<BR>
Three points:<BR>
1) I am guessing that a large percentage of humans has at one time or another
drawn drawn
big-genetalia cartoons. Upon self-reflection, I think it's a perfectly normal
urge. Herman Hesse
refers to it in "Narcissus and Goldmund". I have a feeling that some of your
critics have
forgotten that they have done the exact same thing - or they are secretly
offended that you did it
so much better...<BR>
2) This is a fantastic link send to male friends who are in denial of their
homosexuality.<BR>
3) I think that those of us who think its funny are people who, frankly, have
gotten used to porn,
accept it, and get on with our lives... <BR>
cheers, and thanks for pissing off the squares. Hope you don't mind us
copying your work for

i recently saw your WONDERFUL site goatse.cx.. I WAS SOOO PLEASED!
I thought i was the only one that liked my anus pluged by HUGE FAT DICKS
(not to mention horses and mules) i love the large auns pictures!
Some day i aspire to have someone take a picture of my ass so i can send it
to your site.<BR>
I want to have a picture of my large anus with a rubberband around my balls,
and my little puppy licking my nuts after they turn blue. After that i would
like to get a picture of me and my grandpappy outside with my daddy. I want
gramps to plug my ass with his peep, then have daddy suck me off. If im
lucky, grammy will watch and look at grandpappy, slap on her harness and
cram gramps in the ass.<BR>
THANK YOU!! your picture has inspired my new porn fetish, and my desire to
have my relitves fuck me, while my dog licks my nuts. THANK YOU!!!

Your site is truly excellent. I have single handedly grossed out everyone
in my office. I was greatly upset when I found that (for a couple of days
at least) the dns entry had changed to point to 127.0.0.1.<BR>
I look forward to sending http://goatse.cx to many people in the future.<BR>
Personally, I think that the Receiver is the one of the most disgusting
pictures I have ever seen, but I have come to realize that that isn't the
point. It's not about being disgusted by seeing it...it's about seeing
*others* be disgusted when you show it to them :) And that is what life
is all about.<BR>
Thanks.

Subject: Feedback on the cult phenomenon, goatse.cx<BR>
<BR>
With the rising infamy that has slowly yet surely accumulated since this
brainchild of some perverse yet obscure net personality was concieved,
http://www.goatse.cx/ must be set aside for what it is, and examined with
a non-objective perspective. /How/ has this web page of such striking
simplicity touched so many lives in profound, sometimes even disturbed
ways? Why? What is the driving force that unites so many with pictures of
grotesquely disfigured anal orifices and enlarged penile organs strung to
the tune of a slight yet playful homoerrotic touch? With so many
responses discerned thus far, all with varying opinions as to the value
of this artistic statement, the world may indeed never know, and with
that, we are left instead to simply enjoy in awestruck glory the beauty
of The Receiver, and The Giver.

Kick ass site. It's funny. One prob with it. the word
"goat" is in the domain name. I tried to get my friend
to go to it but he wouldn't cuz he thought it was some
animal sex page. Can you change the name some how.
(Another reason for doing it is that the name has
gotten hella popular even just gegtting a different
name and have that site redirect you to goatse.cx
would be kewl). Keep that grosed out site going!!!!
Everyone on 2600 irc server admires it.
